# BOV_Online (BOVO - Build Order Visualizer Online)

## Purpose
BOVO is a tool that allows StarCraft2 players to get better at the game, faster. It allows users to add graphics to their Build Orders (i.e. strategy guides), so that their strategies can be executed more easily during a game.

I created BOVO when I couldn't find a tool to make reading Build Orders easier. I made it open source so that others can learn from the project structure and implementation. I discuss this further on my youtube channel, Kyle Wilson Code (www.youtube.com/c/KyleWilsonCode).

## Installation
No install necessary. BOVO is built off of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and BootStrap (CDN) only.
