        "Whether you're learning your first build or trying to shave a few seconds off a timing attack, BOVO makes it easier. </p>
    <p>
        By including visuals in build orders, they become easier to read during chaotic games. This allows for better executions and more wins on ladder."

                Hi! I'm Kyle Wilson, the creator of BOVO. I'm a passionate software developer and avid Starcraft 2 Zerg main. For the Swarm!
            </p>
            <p>
                I found Starcraft 2 during quarantine and I was immediately hooked. The thrill of surrounding your opponent with swarm after swarm of Zerg until they break was addicting to say the least. I began watching YouTube tutorials to improve at the game faster. After a month, I climbed my way into Platinum and two months after that I landed in Diamond 3. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One notorious aspect of Starcraft is that it's a difficult game to learn. Learning builds is useful to climb the ladder, but reading build orders is something I've always struggled with. Looking at walls of text while being harrassed by your opponent doesn't work for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I went looking for a tool to make reading Build Orders easier, but when I couldn't find one, I decided to make it myself.
