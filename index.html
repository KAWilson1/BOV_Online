            <p>Hi! I'm Kyle Wilson, the creator of BOVO. I'm a passionate software developer who is also an avid Starcraft 2 Zerg main. For the Swarm!</p>
            <p>I found Starcraft 2 during quarantine and I was immediately hooked. The thrill of surrounding your opponnent with swarms of Zerglings and Banelings while my kniting crew of Queens defended my bases was addicting to say the least.</p>
            <p>One notorious aspect of Starcraft is that it's a difficult game to learn. Learning builds is useful to climb the ladder, but reading build orders is something I've always struggled with. Looking at walls of text while being harrassed by your opponent doesn't work for me. So, I looked for a tool to fix this; a tool that could insert images into build orders, making them easier to read at a glance.</p>
            <p>The issue is that I couldn't find one... So I made it myself.
